My experiments with Python turtle graphics!

These programs are purely creative and not intended to be functional. Incorporate the code into functional programs at your own risk.

If there are any bugs, they are features!

Be aware that some of the programs may take a long time to run, or may hang your computer. If you don't know how to stop a running program, I suggest you don't run these programs.
